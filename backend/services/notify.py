"""Notification helpers — in-app bell feed + email, from one call.

Every notification in this app used to be bell-only: `notify_user` wrote a
`Notification` row and nothing else. That has two failure modes. A Sales Head
who is not in the app does not learn an opportunity is waiting; and an employee
with no login account (`employees.user_id IS NULL`) could not be notified at
all, because both leave and timesheets guard with `if emp.user_id`.

So the bell helpers now also queue an email by default. Existing call sites get
email for free — `notify_role(db, "Sales_Head", ...)` still means the same
thing, it just reaches people who are not looking at the screen.

TWO ADMIN CONTROLS sit between a call site and an inbox, both edited from the
Users tab (no code change, no redeploy):

* ``notification_routes`` — per EVENT: which roles receive it, extra literal
  addresses, and an enabled switch. `notify_role(s)` consult it by the `event`
  key; the roles in code become the DEFAULT for events with no row. A lookup
  failure (table not migrated yet, transient DB error) falls back to the code
  default on a SAVEPOINT, so routing can never take a business transaction
  down with it.
* ``user_notify_prefs.email_paused`` — per PERSON: a leaver's email is paused
  without touching their account, so nothing bounces from a dead mailbox while
  history and bell rows stay intact.

Callers should pass `actor=user` wherever a CurrentUser is in scope. It shapes
the From display name and the Reply-To, so the recipient sees who acted and can
reply straight to them. Set `email=False` for anything too chatty to mail.

Caller commits — email rows are queued on the same session and the same
transaction as the business change, on purpose.
