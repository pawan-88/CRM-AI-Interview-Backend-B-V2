"""Admin-editable action permissions: WHO MAY DO, not just who may see.

Same philosophy as email routing (services.org_settings / notification
routes): the role tuple in code is only the DEFAULT. When Admin/CEO save a
row in `action_permissions`, that row decides which roles may perform the
action — no code change, no redeploy, effective within the cache TTL
(immediately for the admin who saved, via invalidate()).

Two safety properties are non-negotiable:

* Admin/CEO ALWAYS pass — mirrored from role_required(allow_admin=True).
  An empty saved role list therefore means "admins only", never "nobody",
  so an admin cannot lock themselves out of their own application.
* A lookup can never fail closed by accident: any database problem falls
  back to the code default, same as before this table existed.
