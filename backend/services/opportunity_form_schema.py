"""Server-side mirror of the Opportunity form's type-driven schema.

The frontend schema lives in
`src/crm/pages/opportunity/opportunitySchema.ts`. This module is the SERVER's
copy of the same visibility rules so the API can enforce Part 3's rule:

    "The server validates against the SAME schema for the SAME type. A client
     that posts Time & Material fields for a Retainer is rejected. Never trust
     the client."

Type-specific fields are stored in the Opportunity's `details` JSONB column; the
CTC slab is a separate relational table. Core relational columns (customer_id,
title, opp_type, rfi_value, ...) are handled by the Pydantic model as before —
this module governs only the `details` object and the CTC slab, which is where
the type-conditional fields live.

Keep this in sync with the TS schema. Both derive the same key sets.
