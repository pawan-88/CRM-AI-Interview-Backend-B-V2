"""Daily background jobs — the app acting on what it already knows.

Until now this application had no scheduler. Everything it noticed, it noticed
only when a human opened the right screen: the timesheet-due report needed HR
to press a button, the PO-expiry report warned nobody, and `recurring_billing`
on a project did nothing at all. This module closes that gap with three daily
jobs.

FOUR DESIGN RULES, each learned from how this kind of thing usually goes wrong:

1. **Exactly-once, provably.** Every message carries a dedupe key naming the
   exact milestone (``po.expiry:41:15`` = PO 41, fifteen days out). The email
   outbox enforces uniqueness on that key, so a restart, a double run, or two
   app instances cannot produce two emails. Correctness does not depend on the
   scheduler running exactly once.

2. **Catch-up, not clockwork.** The loop checks "has today's run happened
   yet?" instead of firing at an instant. A server that was off at 08:00 and
   starts at 11:00 still runs today's jobs — a fixed-time trigger would skip
   the day silently.

3. **Never break the app.** Every job is wrapped: a failure is logged and the
   other jobs still run. The thread cannot die, and a scheduler problem can
   never take a request path with it.

4. **Admin-visible and admin-controlled.** Each job has an on/off switch and
   the run hour is configurable (Settings), the recipients are the same
   admin-editable Email Flows as everything else, and each run records its
   outcome so the Settings page can prove the scheduler is alive.

# Project-Employee monthly leave credit

    """Credit this month's PE leave, and replay any month that never ran.

    Leave accrual used to be CLI-only (`scripts/run_pe_leave_credit.py`), which
    made it the one piece of business logic in the system that silently did
    nothing when nobody remembered to invoke it. Two failure modes followed
    from that, and this job closes both:

    * **A missed month stayed missed.** The credit function only ever credits
      the month of its ``as_of`` and never backfills, so a month with no run
      left every employee permanently short. Here, `missing_credit_periods`
      finds closed months with no ledger row and replays them at their month
      end before today's credit runs.
    * **A missed 31 December lost the year.** `apply_year_end_carry` acts on
      that single date, so a server that was down over new year skipped carry
      forward and expiry entirely, with no way to notice. Replaying December
      at its month end replays the carry with it.

    Replay is safe to run every day: credits are keyed
    ``pe_credit:{pe}:{type}:{YYYY-MM}``, so a month that already ran credits
    zero the second time. That is also why the alert fires on *balances moved*
    rather than on *months replayed* — a month where nothing was accruable
    looks identical to a month that never ran, and only one of them is worth
    waking somebody up for.
