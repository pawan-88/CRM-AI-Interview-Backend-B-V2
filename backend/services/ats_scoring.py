"""Honest, deterministic ATS resume scorer (pure functions — no DB, fully testable).

Fixes the "random document scores 100%" bug in the previous scorer, which awarded
FULL points for every empty/missing criterion (empty skill pool => full 50, no
optional => full 20, no experience bound => full 15, no location => full 5). A
requirement with no configured skills therefore scored ~90-100% for *any* file.

Design:
  * Gate first — `looks_like_resume` refuses documents that aren't resumes.
  * No free points — score is renormalised over ONLY the criteria that are actually
    configured, so an empty criterion never inflates the score.
  * Fail loud — a requirement with no required skills is a configuration error,
    never a perfect score (`AtsConfigError`).
  * Evidence — every matched skill returns the text snippet proving it.
  * Honest cap — 100% is reachable only when every required skill is matched.
  * JD component — when RMG JD text is present, keyword overlap vs resume is scored
    and weights renormalize; without JD, behavior matches the skills-only scorer.
