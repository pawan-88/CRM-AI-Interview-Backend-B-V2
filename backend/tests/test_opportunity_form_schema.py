"""Server-side schema-parity tests for the type-driven Opportunity form.

Mirrors the mission's "TESTS THAT MUST PASS":
  - each type allows exactly its own fields,
  - every non-T&M type has Project Scope,
  - the server rejects a payload with fields not valid for the chosen type,
  - hidden fields are stripped, not persisted.

Run:  python -m pytest tests/test_opportunity_form_schema.py -q
