"""CRM interview calendar.

One endpoint that answers "what interviews are happening this week", merging AI
L1 sessions and manual rounds — which live in two unrelated tables and, until
now, could not be seen together anywhere in the product.

Visible to TA and RMG (and Admin/CEO, which role_required adds automatically).
Sales and Sales_Head are deliberately excluded: interview scheduling is not
their workflow, and the upcoming-interviews view was removed from their
dashboard at the same time.
