#: Registration order. Names, not objects, so one unimportable module costs
#: only its own routes.
#:
#: This used to be a single `from routers.crm import a, b, c, ...` statement.
#: That makes registration all-or-nothing: any one module raising on import —
#: a bad name, a 3.11-only typing import — aborts the whole statement, and
#: because main.py catches and logs the failure the app still starts and still
#: answers health checks. The only symptom is that all ~266 CRM endpoints 404.
#: That has now happened twice, and both times it looked like a frontend bug.
