# 5. User Journey Diagrams (per role)

Roles come from two systems:

- **Interview platform** (`registration_data.role`): `candidate`, `hr`.
- **CRM RBAC** (`models/rbac.py::RoleName`): `Admin, CEO, Sales, Sales_Head, RMG, TA, HR, Finance`.

## 5.10 Customer → Branch → Project → Team drill-down

Sales / Sales_Head (and any role with Customers/Projects access) navigate delivery
context via row clicks and a shared `CrmBreadcrumb` trail. Existing detail routes
are reused — no new pages.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    list["Customers list"] --> cust["customers/:id<br/>CustomerDetailPage"]
    cust -->|"Branches tab · row click"| branch["branch-policy/:id<br/>BranchPolicyPage<br/>Projects section"]
    branch -->|"project row → crmNavigate"| proj["projects/:id<br/>ProjectDetailPage<br/>Overview · Team · Timesheet · PO & Invoices"]
    proj -->|"Team tab · row click<br/>pe_id"| pe["project-employees/:id<br/>ProjectEmployeeDetailPage"]
    crumbs["CrmBreadcrumb<br/>Customers / Customer / Branch / Project / Employee"]
    cust -.-> crumbs
    branch -.-> crumbs
    proj -.-> crumbs
    pe -.-> crumbs
```

Breadcrumb crumbs (last = current, not a link):

| Page | Trail |
|------|-------|
| Customer detail | `Customers / {customer}` |
| Branch policy | `Customers / {customer} / {branch}` |
| Project detail | `Customers / {customer} / {branch} / {project}` |
| Project employee | `Customers / {customer} / {branch} / {project} / {employee}` |

Row-click actions (Edit/Delete) use `stopPropagation` so they do not navigate.
List Delete opens **ConfirmModal** (“Do you want to delete this …?”); on confirm the
row is removed from list state immediately (`afterListDelete`) then soft-refreshed —
no need to open the entity and navigate back. After a dependency **409**, ConfirmModal
disables Delete (Close to dismiss); Employees offer **Deactivate** (`PUT is_active=false`)
when hard-delete is blocked.
Serializer additions for crumbs: project detail `customer_id`/`customer_name`/`branch_id`/`branch_name`
(via `project.branch_id` then **same-customer** opportunity branch; foreign opp branches suppressed
with `branch_unlinked` / “Branch not linked to this customer”); PE detail top-level
`branch_id`/`branch_name`; branch policy `customer_name` + `linked_projects`; team rows `pe_id`.
`projects.branch_id` (0045) is the explicit Branch→Project link; legacy rows fall back to
same-customer `opportunity.branch_id` only. `ensure_project_branch_id` never overwrites a
non-null `project.branch_id` (PUT opportunity change also keeps an existing branch when
the new opp branch is foreign). Timesheet detail header uses `pe_effective_branch` /
`_project_branch` — never raw `opp.branch_id` — so a stray cross-customer opportunity branch
(e.g. Harman under BMW) cannot appear in the timesheet Branch field. Disagreement between
`project.branch_id` and `opportunity.branch_id` is logged.

### PE Holidays + leave sync
- Holidays tab / timesheet holiday dates resolve branch via
  `pe_effective_branch` / `effective_customer_branch_for_project`
  (`project.branch_id` → same-customer opportunity branch → calendar/leave fallbacks).
  Wrong cross-customer opportunity branches are ignored.
- `POST /api/projects/employees/{pe_id}/leave/sync` (Admin/HR) back-fills missing leave types from
  customer/branch policy without mutating existing balances (idempotent).
- Leave accrual start: `accrual_start = max(CustomerLeavePolicy.effective_date, PE.onboarding_date)`
  (missing side = no bound). Monthly credit job credits 0 for periods ending before that date;
  One_Time / Yearly-start with a future start opens at 0 and is granted by the credit job on/after
  the start month. Editing `effective_date` later does not rewrite already-seeded balances.
